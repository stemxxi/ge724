                        <p class="collapse-text">1. When given three choices, like above, you are likely to hear the speaker talking about all three options. Just because you hear it mentioned, doesn’t make it correct. You must select the correct answer, not the first one you hear.</p>
                        <p class="collapse-text">2. The answers will normally come in the form of synonyms or paraphrases. Don’t just listen for exact matches; think about how the answer could be expressed using synonyms or paraphrasing.</p>
                        <p class="collapse-text">3. The three choices often look similar in meaning and it may be difficult for you to tell the difference. Look for keywords in the different options that allow you to tell the difference between the different options.</p>
                        <p class="collapse-text">4. This is not just a test of your listening skills but also your reading skills. There is much more to read in multiple choice questions, so practice underlining the keywords in the questions and quickly understanding the difference between the different options.</p>

                        <p class="collapse-text">1. Don’t check your answers from the previous section when you have a break. It is important that you read the multiple choice questions and try to understand them.</p>
                        <p class="collapse-text">2. Highlight keywords. The keyword in the question will help you answer the question correctly. The keywords in the different options are those that differentiate meaning between the choices.</p>
                        <p class="collapse-text">3. Don’t write the first answer you hear. Remember that they will try and trick you.</p>
                        <p class="collapse-text">4. Don’t spend too much time on one question. If you didn’t get the answer or you are unsure, make an educated guess and move on.</p>
                        <p class="collapse-text">5. Be careful if you hear words like ‘but’ or ‘however’. This often means that the speaker is going to qualify a previous statement.</p>
                        <p class="collapse-text">6. Practice makes perfect.</p>
                        <p class="collapse-text">7. Your answer will often be a letter and not a word. Read the instructions to make sure and be careful when transferring your answers at the end.</p>
